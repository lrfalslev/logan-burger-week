                <strong>1. They May Run Out</strong> — These burgers are special and in high demand. If a place sells out toward the end of the day, come back earlier tomorrow — and thank the staff for hustling to make this event happen.
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>2. Expect Waits</strong> — Burger week can get busy. Plan ahead, bring friends, and savor the vibe.
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>3. Tip Generously</strong> — Your bill might be lower than usual thanks to Burger Week specials, but your servers and cooks are working harder than ever. Show them some love.
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>4. Order a Drink or Side</strong> — Pick up some fries, onion rings, and a drink. Make it a full experience.
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>5. Check Before You Go</strong> — Look up restaurant hours and carry out policies ahead of time, and follow them on social media to see if they've sold out.
            </div>
            <div>
                <strong>6. Share the Love</strong> — Post your burger pics with <span class="text-blue-500">#LoganBurgerWeek</span> on Instagram and Facebook.
